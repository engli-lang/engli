# Phonetic Rules

Engli uses the Latin alphabet, just like English. However, unlike English, Engli assigns a single sound to each letter.

With Engli's phonetic rigidity, once you know the language, you don't need IPA to know how words in it are read. IPA transcriptions can be generated from any Engli word just based on its letters.

Here is a table of the English sounds each letter corresponds to in Engli:

| Engli Letter | English Sound | English Sound Example |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| a            | aa            | **a**wesome           |
| b            | b             | **b**arely            |
| c            | th (hard)     | **th**en              |
| d            | d             | **d**og               |
| e            | eh            | **e**gg               |
| f            | f             | **f**ox               |
| g            | g (not j)     | **g**oat              |
| h            | h (exhale)    | **h**ouse             |
| i            | i             | **i**t                |
| j            | j             | **j**ump              |
| k            | k             | **k**ite              |
| l            | l             | **l**amp              |
| m            | m             | **m**ouse             |
| n            | n             | **n**est              |
| o            | ah            | f**o**g               |
| p            | p             | **p**ig               |
| q            | ng            | si**ng**              |
| r            | er            | **r**un               |
| s            | ss            | **s**nake             |
| t            | t             | **t**iger             |
| u            | uh            | **u**mbrella          |
| v            | v             | **v**iolin            |
| w            | oo            | **w**ater             |
| x            | sh            | **sh**oe              |
| y            | ee            | **y**es               |
| z            | z             | **z**ebra             |

It's important to note that Engli is more than just new phonetic rules. We also change words, add new ones, etc. Thus, simply converting an English word based on the above table will not always lead to the equivalent Engli word.

Here is an example process of reading the Engli word "eqly" using on the above table:

1. We start with the letter `e`. We find `e` in the table's left column, and its corresponding sound in the middle column is the English sound `eh`, as the "e" makes in the English word "egg."
2. The next letter is `q`. We find `q` in the table's left column, and its corresponding sound in the middle is `ng`, as in the English word "sing."
3. We continue with `l`, which corresponds to `l`, as in "lamp."
4. Finally, we have `y`, which corresponds to `ee`, as in "yes."
5. Putting it all together, we get `eh-ng-l-ee`, which is how "eqly" is pronounced â€” not as "eklee," which we would get if we tried to read it as English.

Over time, Engli speakers should get "muscle memory" for Engli without needing the table as a reference.

New words in Engli are typically added by recreating the sound of the word in English as closely as possible in Engli, usually manually. However, this is not always the case, and sometimes words in Engli will sound different from their English counterparts.
