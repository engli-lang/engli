# Introduction

The Engli language is a new language based on English with some changes aiming to make it more logical, and easier to learn.

Here are some of its key features:

- **0 collisions** — No words sound identical, and English words with multiple meanings that differ too much are split into multiple words
- **Phonetically rigid** — Each letter only has one sound, and the letters surrounding it have no impact on that
- **0 ambiguity** — There is only one way to spell any word, and only one way to pronounce it
- **0 inconsistency** — Prefixes and suffixes will stay separate from a word, like "multi-player" instead of "multiplayer"
- **International** — No more divide between "center" and "centre", "sentr" is used instead
- **Faster to type in** — Most words are shorter, which allows you to type faster

This is the full specification of the Engli language. The goals of this specification are to unambiguously define every aspect of the language, and to provide a reference for anyone who wants to learn or use the language.
