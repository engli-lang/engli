# Sentence Structure

Engli's sentence structure is the same as English's, requiring a subject, verb, and optionally an object.

Interjections and exclamations such as "wow" or "ouch" are, of course, valid Engli, but they are not considered complete sentences on their own.

During translation from English to Engli, you will find that individual translation of each word in a sentence always produces valid Engli. Thus, automatic translation to Engli is possible without machine learning, but translation back to English may break on Engli words that have no English equivalent.

## Capitalization

Engli uses the same capitalization rules as English. The first letter of a sentence is always capitalized, as well as proper nouns.

In informal writing, such as texting, lack of capitalization or ending punctuation should never be treated as a mistake in an Engli sentence.

## Punctuation

Engli uses the same punctuation as English, with a few minor differences:

### Quotation Marks

In English, punctuation goes inside quotes, such as `He said, "Hello."` instead of `He said, "Hello".`.

However, in Engli, the opposite is true. Punctuation goes outside of quotes, except when the punctuation is part of the quote.

For example:

> Hy sed, "Heluw", suw I sed "Heluw, how ar yw?" tu him.

In the above simple example, the comma is outside of the quotes, but the question mark is inside the quotes, since it is part of the quote.

### En Dash

In Engli, the en dash is used in the same way as in English, to indicate a range of values, such as `1â€“10`. However, in Engli, the en dash can be substituted with a hyphen, (`1-10`) and the result will still be considered correct Engli, even in formal contexts. It is left as a stylistic choice for the writer.

### Parentheses

In Engli, parentheses are used in the same way as in English, to enclose additional information.

Commas can be added before and after parentheses to indicate a pause in speech, but this is not required.

For example:

> I went tu cu stuwr (witx wuz kluwzd) tu bay sum milk.

> I went tu cu stuwr, (witx wuz kluwzd), tu bay sum milk.

Both of the above examples are considered correct Engli. Note that in the second example, the comma goes outside of the parentheses.
