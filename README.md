# Engli

### Language Overview

Engli is a new language based on English (more details will be added here soon)

### Technical Description

Engli is a declaratively defined community "fork" of English with 0 collisions, 0 ambiguity, fully deterministic spelling/pronunciation via rigid phonetics, and more.

The language is defined entirely in `.toml` files in `words/`, as well as `.md` files in `spec/`. Dictionaries can thus be easily compiled from this repository to any format, such as HTML, LaTeX or others.

### License

Given the language is defined declaratively in a source code-like format, the project uses the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md).
